# OpenAI API SwiftUI User Interface

This project provides a user interface built with SwiftUI that allows you to interact with the OpenAI API.

This was created in collaboration with ChatGPT.

## Getting started

To use this interface, you will need to obtain an API key from the OpenAI API site and pass it as the authToken parameter in the OpenAISwift initializer.

Once you have an auth token you can uncomment this line and replace `<AUTH_TOKEN>` with your actual token.

```swift
enum Auth {
//    static let token = "<AUTH_TOKEN>"
}
```
